# bird-vision

This is a machine vision project to read information off of a live stream of Final Fantasy Tactics, called [FFTBG](https://www.twitch.tv/fftbattleground).

All of this code is written in Python, particulary with `opencv` and `tensorflow`. Everything you need should be in the Pipefile *except* for potentially `ffmpeg` and `stream-link`.

There is a lot of data that goes along with this project, and to download it you will need to make use of `git-lfs`.
